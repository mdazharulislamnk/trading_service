| **API Endpoint: Link Account** | ✅ **Done** | `app/api/endpoints.py`: `POST /accounts` links a user to a broker account. |
| **Mock Broker Simulation** | ✅ **Done** | `app/services/broker.py`: Simulates `PENDING` -> `EXECUTED` -> `CLOSED` with random PnL and delays. |
| **Real-time Updates** | ✅ **Done** | `app/api/websockets.py`: WebSocket manager broadcasts order status changes to connected clients. |
| **Async Processing** | ✅ **Done** | `app/api/endpoints.py`: Uses FastAPI `BackgroundTasks` to process orders without blocking the API response. |
